Exercise brief

Design an app for Android devices which will enable the user to search for movies/shows using IMDB, OMDB or a similar API, pick their favorites and hide those they do not wish to see or have already seen.

Tasks

All of the information should be retrieved from the external APIs (you are free to choose which API you would like to use)
By default the main screen should show movies and shows the user has added to their favorites list (title, movie poster, description and rating)
Implement an option to search for a specific movie/show
Once a user clicks on a movie/show a screen containing title, description, rating, movie/show poster should be shown
Implement an option to add the movie/show to favorites list (this should persist on app restart)
Implement an option to hide movie/show form future search results (this should persist on app restart)
User should be informed if the internet connection is lost
Take time to think about possible edge cases and access issues that should be solved
